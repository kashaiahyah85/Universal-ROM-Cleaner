This software allows you to easily clean your romsets based on the parenthetical and bracketed parts of rome file names via drag-and-drop.

# Usage

1. In the File/Load roms menu, choose the directory of your set to clean.
2. In the table on the left, order your preferences (what you want to keep the most at the top, the least in the base) 14 5 - Move in the table at the top on the right what you do not want to keep 15 6 - Move in the table at the bottom right which should not be taken into account in the sorting 16 7 - In the action menu you can either simulate the sorting (you will then have a text file with OK which is kept, KO which is not 'is not kept) or do the cleaning directly 17 8 - It's finished, you have a nice clean romset for your recalbox) 18 19 __Additional information: __ 20 The software does not delete anything, it only moves to a directory ‚ÄúROM_CLEAN‚Äù the selected and sorted roms 21 22!
